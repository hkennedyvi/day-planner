# Unit 05 Third-Party APIs Homework: Day Planner

The following application will perform as a day panner for it's user. 

Once opened, the page displays the current day, date, and time. Below that is a grid of timeblocks - one for each hour in a traditional workday - that are color coded based on whether that block is in the past, present, or future. 

Each timeblock will have a text field and submission button that can be used to add items to a daily schedule. These inputs will be stored in localStorage as well. 

This day planner is designed with intuitive color scheming to help with time management and to provide user-friendly functionality.
